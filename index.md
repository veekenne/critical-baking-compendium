# Howdy Stranger #
Hi! I'm Vee Kennedy (they/them/theirs) and I'm a Visiting Instructor in the Department of Rhetoric and Writing at the University of Central Florida. I'm also a student in the [Texts and Technology PhD Program](https://cah.ucf.edu/textstech/){:target="_blank"} at UCF.

Here's a very brief list of examples of creations I'm most proud of from Critical Making<br><br>
