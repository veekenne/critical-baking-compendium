Hi! I'm Vee Kennedy (they/them/theirs) and I'm a Visiting Instructor in the Department of Rhetoric and Writing at the University of Central Florida. I'm also a student in the [Texts and Technology PhD Program](https://cah.ucf.edu/textstech/){:target="_blank"} at UCF. My research interests are at the intersections of queer and trans rhetorics, game studies, fandom, neurodivergence and (dis)ability. I also recently pursued certification with the Global Society of Online Literacy Educators, and this site is currently serving as my portfolio for that project. Please see the 'Materials' and 'Projects' tabs for my artifacts from GSOLE Certification.
